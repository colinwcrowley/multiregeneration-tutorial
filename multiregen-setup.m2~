R = CC[x,y,z]

-- Run whatever code you need to to get the system you want --



--------------------------------------------------------------

-- Here's an example system you might like to solve 
system = {x^2*y + y*z^2 + y*x + 2, y^2 + x^2 - z^2*y^2 + 1, x*y*z - 5}

-- Here are some example variable groups. Variable group 0 is {x,z} and variable group 1 is {y}
-- Recall that choosing different variable groups could speed up or slow down the computation.
-- What you want to look for when choosing variable groups is for variables in the same group (e.g. x and z)
-- not to be in the same terms. You can see that in the system above, x and z are rarely in the same term, so
-- the grouping below is a good guess for the best variable grouping.
variable_groups = {{x,z}, {y}}

-- Now we write the input files for multiregeneration.py

-- First we need the equations
